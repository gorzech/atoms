### Sustainable Mechatronics

Located at LUT Lahti. The only mechanical engineering outpost of LUT. Custom designs, industrial applications, virtual engineering, and value offer via operational digital twins. 

We develop simulation and digital twin methods for autonomous and human-aware machinery, including:

- multibody and hydraulic system modeling
- sim-to-real workflows
- data-driven surrogate models
- human/environment modeling for safety

Selected domains: logistics, healthcare, forestry, construction, non-road mobile machinery.
